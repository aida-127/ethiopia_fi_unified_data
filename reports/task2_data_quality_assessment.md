# Data Quality Assessment

## Summary
- Total Records: 58
- Completeness: 58.5%
- Temporal Coverage: 5844 days
- Value Conflicts: 0

## Key Limitations
1. **Sparse Time Series**: Only 5 Findex survey points over 13 years for key indicators
2. **Inconsistent Frequency**: Some indicators annual, others sporadic
3. **Source Mix**: Combination of survey (demand-side) and operator (supply-side) data
4. **Gender Disaggregation**: Limited to few indicators and years
5. **Regional Data**: Almost exclusively national-level aggregates

## Recommendations for Task 3
1. Use interpolation cautiously for missing years
2. Focus on leading indicators with more frequent data (infrastructure metrics)
3. Consider comparable country evidence for event impact estimation
4. Use wide confidence intervals given data sparsity
